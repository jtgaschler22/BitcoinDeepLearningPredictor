# Bitcoin Deep Learning Predictor
![deep-learning.jpg](Images/deep-learning.jpg)

This model uses bitcoin price data from 2018 - 2019 as well as the Crypto Fear and Greed Index (FNG) to make predication on it's price movements. The model's performance was relatively okay overall. It caught the general upward trend from the lows in 2018, however the actual price movements were far more volatile than than the model was predicting. 

At some point in the future I would like to rerun this model with more recent data, perhaps 2020 - 2021 to see its predictions. This period of time is expoeriencing even higher volatility, so I will liekly want to try and add in additional metrics to help get a higher accuracy in its predictions.
